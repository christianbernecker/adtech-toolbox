    <h2>General Information on Data Processing</h2>
    
    <h3>Scope of Processing Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
        We generally only process personal data of our users to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly only with the consent of the user.
    </p>

    <h3>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
        The legal basis for processing personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR if the user has given consent.
        For the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract to which the user is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures.
    </p>

    <h2>Provision of the Website and Creation of Log Files</h2>
    
    <h3>Description and Scope of Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
        Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer.
        The following data is collected in this process:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information about the browser type and version used</li>
        <li>The user's operating system</li>
        <li>The user's IP address</li>
        <li>Date and time of access</li>
        <li>Websites from which the user's system reaches our website</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The data is also stored in the log files of our system. A storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place.
    </p>

    <h3>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
        The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose of Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
        The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to allow delivery of the website to the user's computer. For this, the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.
        The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data helps us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.
        For these purposes, our legitimate interest lies in the processing of data according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>Duration of Storage</h3>
    <p>
        The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. In the case of collecting data for providing the website, this is the case when the respective session is ended.
        In the case of storing the data in log files, this is after seven days at the latest. Further storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of users are deleted or alienated, so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        Our website does not use cookies or other tracking technologies.
    </p>

    </ul>
    <p>
        You can delete this data at any time through your browser settings.
